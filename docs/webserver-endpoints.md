# Webserver Endpoints

This document describes the HTTP, WebSocket, WebDAV, and discovery endpoints
available while the device is in File Transfer mode (Settings > System > File
Transfer).

- HTTP server: port 80
- WebSocket upload server: port 81
- UDP discovery listener: port 8134
- WebDAV: port 80, handled by the same HTTP server

Examples use `berean.local`, which is the mDNS name the firmware still
advertises; it is an inherited string, not a different device. If mDNS does not
resolve on your network, use the IP address shown on the device screen.

## HTTP Pages

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/` | Home/status page |
| `GET` | `/files` | File manager page |
| `GET` | `/settings` | Web settings page |
| `GET` | `/fonts` | SD-card font manager page |
| `GET` | `/js/jszip.min.js` | JavaScript asset used by the file manager |

## Device Status

### `GET /api/status`

```bash
curl http://berean.local/api/status
```

Response:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "mode": "STA",
  "rssi": -45,
  "freeHeap": 123456,
  "uptime": 3600,
  "device": "X4"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `version` | string | Firmware version |
| `ip` | string | Device IP address |
| `mode` | string | `"STA"` for joined Wi-Fi or `"AP"` for hotspot mode |
| `rssi` | number | Wi-Fi RSSI in dBm; `0` in AP mode |
| `freeHeap` | number | Free heap in bytes |
| `uptime` | number | Seconds since boot |
| `device` | string | `"X3"` or `"X4"` hardware detection |

## File Management

### `GET /api/files`

Lists files and folders under a directory.

```bash
curl "http://berean.local/api/files?path=/Books"
```

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | No | `/` | Directory to list |

Response:

```json
[
  {"name":"MyBook.epub","size":1234567,"isDirectory":false,"isEpub":true},
  {"name":"Notes","size":0,"isDirectory":true,"isEpub":false}
]
```

Protected entries — anything whose name starts with `.`, plus
`System Volume Information` and `XTCache` — are never listed, whatever
`showHiddenFiles` says. Every route that takes a path (`/api/files`,
`/download`, `/upload`, `/mkdir`, `/rename`, `/move`, `/delete`, the WebSocket
`START`, and WebDAV) refuses the request when any component of the path is
protected; `..` counts as one. HTTP routes answer `403` (`/upload` answers `400`
with the reason); `/delete` lists the
item as failed; the WebSocket answers `ERROR:`.

### `GET /download`

Downloads a file from the SD card.

```bash
curl -OJ "http://berean.local/download?path=/Books/MyBook.epub"
```

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes | File path to download |

Protected dotfiles, `System Volume Information`, and `XTCache` cannot be
downloaded. EPUB files are served as `application/epub+zip`; other files use
`application/octet-stream`.

### `GET /migration`

Streams `/.berean/migration-report.json`, the report the study-data migration
writes at boot.

- `200` with the report as `application/json`
- `404` `{"status":"no migration has run"}` when no report exists
- `500` `{"status":"report unreadable"}` when the file cannot be opened

### `POST /upload`

Uploads a file with HTTP multipart form data.

```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@mybook.epub" "http://berean.local/upload?path=/Books"
```

Query parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `path` | No | `/` | Destination directory |

Successful response:

```text
File uploaded successfully: mybook.epub
```

Notes:

- An existing file with the same name is never overwritten; the upload is refused.
- EPUB cache data for the uploaded path is cleared after a successful upload.
- HTTP upload uses a 4 KB write buffer before flushing to the SD card.

### `POST /mkdir`

Creates a folder.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "name=NewFolder&path=/" http://berean.local/mkdir
```

Form parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | - | New folder name |
| `path` | No | `/` | Parent folder |

### `POST /rename`

Renames a file.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "path=/Books/old.epub&name=new.epub" http://berean.local/rename
```

Form parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes | Existing file path |
| `name` | Yes | New file name, not a path |

Only files can be renamed through this endpoint. The old EPUB cache path is
cleared before the rename.

### `POST /move`

Moves a file into an existing folder.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "path=/Books/mybook.epub&dest=/Read" http://berean.local/move
```

Form parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes | Existing file path |
| `dest` | Yes | Existing destination folder |

Only files can be moved through this endpoint. The old EPUB cache path is
cleared before the move.

### `POST /delete`

Deletes one or more files or empty folders.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "path=/Books/mybook.epub" http://berean.local/delete
curl -X POST -d 'paths=["/Books/old.epub","/OldFolder"]' http://berean.local/delete
```

Form parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | Yes, unless `paths` is provided | Single path to delete |
| `paths` | Yes, unless `path` is provided | JSON array of paths to delete |

Protected items cannot be deleted. Non-empty folders are rejected. EPUB cache
data for deleted files is cleared.

## Settings API

### `GET /api/settings`

Returns a streamed JSON array of editable settings. Each item contains common
fields plus type-specific fields.

```bash
curl http://berean.local/api/settings
```

Example item:

```json
{
  "key": "fontSize",
  "name": "Reader Font Size",
  "category": "Reader",
  "type": "enum",
  "value": 1,
  "options": ["12 pt", "14 pt", "16 pt", "18 pt"]
}
```

`value` is always an index into `options`, never the option's text. `fontSize`
is one of the settings whose `options` are built at request time — they are the
point sizes the selected font family actually ships, so a family installed at
10/12/14 offers three options. `fontFamily` varies the same way, from the SD
card contents.

A few settings are exposed here but hidden from the on-device Settings screen,
because another surface owns them: `downloadFolder` (where meeting publications
are written), and the frontlight state the swipe panel edits.

Types:

| Type | Extra fields |
|------|--------------|
| `toggle` | `value` (`0` or `1`) |
| `enum` | `value`, `options` |
| `value` | `value`, `min`, `max`, `step` |
| `string` | `value` |

The font-family setting includes SD-card font families when they are installed.

### `POST /api/settings`

Applies a partial settings update from a JSON object.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fontSize":2,"showHiddenFiles":1}' \
  http://berean.local/api/settings
```

Successful response:

```text
Applied 2 setting(s)
```

## Font Management API

### `GET /api/fonts`

Lists installed SD-card font families.

```bash
curl http://berean.local/api/fonts
```

Response:

```json
{
  "maxFamilies": 128,
  "families": [
    {
      "name": "Literata",
      "sizes": [12, 14, 16, 18],
      "files": [
        {"name": "Literata_12.cpfont", "size": 123456}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /api/fonts/upload`

Uploads one `.cpfont` file into a family folder.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "family=Literata" \
  -F "file=@Literata_12.cpfont" \
  http://berean.local/api/fonts/upload
```

The handler validates the family name, `.cpfont` filename, and `CPFONT` magic
bytes before accepting the file.

Successful response:

```json
{"ok":true}
```

### `POST /api/fonts/delete`

Deletes an installed font family.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"family":"Literata"}' \
  http://berean.local/api/fonts/delete
```

Successful response:

```json
{"ok":true}
```

## Wi-Fi Credential API

### `GET /api/wifi`

Lists saved Wi-Fi networks. Passwords are never returned.

```bash
curl http://berean.local/api/wifi
```

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "index": 0,
    "ssid": "HomeWiFi",
    "hasPassword": true,
    "isLastConnected": true
  }
]
```

### `POST /api/wifi`

Adds or updates a saved Wi-Fi network. Include `index` to update an existing
entry. If `password` is omitted during an update, the existing password is
preserved.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ssid":"HomeWiFi","password":"secret"}' \
  http://berean.local/api/wifi
```

### `POST /api/wifi/delete`

Deletes a saved Wi-Fi network by index.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"index":0}' \
  http://berean.local/api/wifi/delete
```

## WebSocket Upload

### Port 81

The WebSocket path is used for fast binary uploads from the file manager.

Connection:

```text
ws://berean.local:81/
```

Protocol:

1. Client sends text: `START:<filename>:<size>:<path>`
2. Server replies `READY`
3. Client sends binary chunks
4. Server sends `PROGRESS:<received>:<total>` every 64 KB or at completion
5. Server sends `DONE` when complete or `ERROR:<message>` on failure

Example session:

```text
Client -> START:mybook.epub:1234567:/Books
Server -> READY
Client -> [binary chunk]
Server -> PROGRESS:65536:1234567
...
Server -> DONE
```

Error messages include:

| Message | Cause |
|---------|-------|
| `ERROR:Upload already in progress` | A second upload was started before the first completed |
| `ERROR:Invalid START format` | Malformed START message or invalid size token |
| `ERROR:Failed to create file` | Destination file could not be opened |
| `ERROR:No upload in progress` | Binary data arrived without a matching START |
| `ERROR:Upload overflow` | Client sent more bytes than declared |
| `ERROR:Write failed - disk full?` | SD write failed |

Incomplete WebSocket uploads are deleted on disconnect or error.

## WebDAV

The same HTTP server registers a WebDAV-compatible handler for file manager clients.

Supported methods:

```text
OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, PROPFIND, MKCOL, MOVE, COPY, LOCK, UNLOCK
```

Notes:

- `PUT` writes to a temporary `.davtmp` file first, then renames it into place.
- Protected paths are rejected.
- `LOCK` and `UNLOCK` are accepted for client compatibility only. The server
  does not implement full WebDAV Class 2 locking semantics such as persistent
  locks or lock discovery.

## UDP Discovery

The server listens on UDP port `8134`. When it receives the text payload
`hello`, it replies to the sender with:

```text
crosspoint (on <hostname>);81
```

The final field is the WebSocket upload port.

## Network Modes

### Station Mode (STA)

- Device joins an existing 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network.
- `berean.local` is advertised with mDNS when available.
- `/api/status` returns `"mode": "STA"` and RSSI in dBm.

### Access Point Mode (AP)

- Device creates an open hotspot named `bereanOS`.
- The device shows a Wi-Fi QR code and URL QR code.
- The fallback IP is typically `192.168.4.1`.
- `/api/status` returns `"mode": "AP"` and `"rssi": 0`.
